The teenagers Charlie McGrath &amp; Ben Farrar have taken a big leap from Division 2 to play for the Hyndburn side and not done too badly so far either, but even with the experienced campaigners of Mick Moir &amp; Graham Young playing alongside it would be a big ask for them to gain the honours of champions this season. It is great though what coach Mick Moir is doing bringing on the league’s young talent. The only other unbeaten side East Lancs with 3/3 may also have their own aspirations after a good start.

Unbeaten though with 3/3 and looking to challenge again after just missing promotion last year are the ever experienced ‘Old Masters’. The Lions demoted from the Premier will hope to boomerang back up but with a win and a draw so far may have now realised they can’t take it for granted. Last years Div 2 champions KSB C (were ‘B’ last year), have found the step up a division a difficult adjustment and could struggle having already lost 4/4.

But the favourites for the division title will be Tackyfire who are also unbeaten with 3/3 after playing perhaps stronger teams early on than the two teams currently above them. It’s hard to tell the form of some teams having already fallen a few fixtures behind, but Whalley Falcons having played 3 and lost 3 look as if they are going to have a long difficult campaign<br><p><br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>Team Played Won Drawn Lost Pts<br><p>1.

All the other 6 teams in division 3 have added to the league new players this year and all have competed well so far and will continue to improve. That is especially the case for the new youngsters of Hyndburn F who are already showing they have some good skills which when harnessed will begin to win games in the future.<br><p><br><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

KSB ‘B’ led forward by Ray Kay (3/3) are also setting their sights on promotion as they won 22:9 v their club colleagues KSB ‘C’. Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ lost a little hope in the promotion battle losing this week to HSC 13:23 with HSC’s Frank Hamer in good form and winning all his games.

Clitheroe A, featuring Phil Riley, Dave Kay &amp; Mark Hanson also started in devestating fashion with a 30:2 thrashing of the Lions.

A quickly improving crop of young players Benn Farrar, Charlie McGrath &amp; Ben Duffy coached By Mick Moir playing for Hyndburn D this year, had a impressive win 25:16 verses Whalley Kestrals with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie picking up a max 9 points each. Another promising young team is the lads Keiran Cunliffe, Adam Robinson and Jim Atherton who make up Whalley Hawks and had a good win v KSB D 24:17 with Keiran undefeated on the night.  KSB ‘D’ had better fortunes as they beat Adpak Aces 26:13.<p><h2>Third Division</h2><p>In Division 3 with Ian Mills in great form having won his first 6 games  with the loss of just 1 set helped Doals Marauders to the top of the table with two good wins  21:17 v clubmates Rolling Doals, and followed it with a 26:6 v newcomers Hyndburn F, though the young newcomers showed enough to indicate they will improve very quickly! KSB E had a close win 19:17 v club friends KSB F though Ross Erwin lost to an impressive Carlton Cooper who got 100% on the night.

In second place are Hyndburn TTC A with 3/3 wins, this week overcoming Hyndburners 22:12 with a 100% evening for Mick Moir &amp; 3 wins also for Andrew Jackson. Young Ben Duffy standing in as reserve for the winners did well in stepping up two divisions to take a set off Fred Wade. Another unbeaten team are Burnley Boys Club who with Martin Wyatt untouchable on the night beat Ward &amp; Stobbart away 24:13. Only having played 2 but also unbeaten so far are Clitheroe LMC A, who were victorious 26:15 over early strugglers East Lancs on the back of 3 good wins from Phil Riley.

Ian Mills unbeaten in their two wins this week, 21:19 v Doals Jetstream &amp; 23:12 v KSB F is in good form, though he lost his first singles game of the season to a thus far unbeaten Richard Staines ,as Marauders lost their first match to an impressive looking Hyndburn TTC E 14:22 with the Hyndburn juniors looking like they could feature in the promotion race. The other Hyndburn junior team ‘F’ won their first game 22:13 against other newcomers Doals Vikings. Zac Geldard won 3 for the victors but Paul Milnes also did well for the losers notching up his first two league singles wins.  Vikings had even less fortune v Hyndburn TTC E losing at home 9:29, as Elliot Simpson &amp; Burhan Khan went undefeated, though Vikings own promising junior Daniel O’Sullivan gained his first ever league singles win in only his second competitive match. Rolling Doals with Neil Hepworth &amp; Ryan Fallon unbeaten on the night ‘rolled’ over club mates Doals Jetstream 27:12.

Michael Moir for Hyndburn TTC A has started as he means to go on and sits top of the individual merit table. Table Tennis is a genuinely gender inclusive sport in which men and women play in the same league and it is good to see Mandy Winskill from Ramsbottom A up there in the top four merit table. <p><p>Old Masters lead the table in Division One but again it is HSC and KSB A with 100% records so far that are likely to challenging for promotion. Matt Hirst from KSB A will take some toppling and is already top of the Div one merit table.<p><p>KSB D are top of the table in Division two but as in the other divisions due to more games played than two other teams yet unbeaten. Whalley Hawks have played two and won two and this young team look like they will make a promotion challenge when they get more games in. Looking very impressive though, and my early tip to win the division is Hyndburn TTC D, another young team with Ben Farrer and Charlie McGrath both playing superbly and heading up the individual merit tables.<p><p>Doals Marauders having won 4 out of 5 are doing well and are top of Division Three, but of all the divisions the third looks the most open as perhaps any two from 6 teams could still emerge as the front runners. Hyndburn TTC E, another team of young people have started well and look promising, and KSB E as well as Whalley Phoenix are yet unbeaten. Richard Staines for Hyndburn TTC E is a young man vastly improved and hasn’t lost a game yet and is leading the merit table with an impressive 93%. <p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

This takes Hyndburn TTC D to the top of <strong>Division Two</strong> with 5/5 wins, but Whalley Hawks are still likely to remain their closest challengers.

The Division looks wide open at present with just 7 points separating 5th place Hyndburn and top place Nets N Edges, yet unbeaten KSB A in 6th place but with 2 games in hand and only 26 points behind the top spot are likely to leap frog to the top once they catch up with fixtures.<p><p>KSB E won again convincingly 28:7 v Doals Vikings in <strong>Division Three</strong> as Michael Mullarkey and Ross Erwin were unbeaten to make it 5/5 straight wins and be the only unbeaten team in the division but still are a little of the pace of the promotion chase due to a lower total set points score despite their overall wins. Doals Marauders also won well v Doals Vikings 27:7 with Ian Mills &amp; Dominic Walsh gaining 3 wins each to keep themselves at the top of the table, despite losing in a very close game 20:21 to Whalley Falcons who had Kim Croyden in great form and man of the match with 3/3.

KSB A increased their supremacy of the division with a 30:8 thrashing of a depleted Nets n Edges 30:9. KSB B beat Clitheroe LMC B 22:14 with Trevor Elkington &amp; Ray Kay unbeaten for the home team.

Burnley Boys Club are looking value for money for the second place spot and not surprisingly have two players in the top 5 merit places in Martin Wyatt (3rd) with 76% &amp; Andrea Harrison proving to be a leading lady in 5th spot with 63%. Clitheroe LMC A are in third place. Another lady going strong is Mandy Winskill of Ramsbottom A in 4th place in the merits with 63%.<p><p>KSB A unbeaten after 7 wins have a clear lead at top of Division One and look uncatchable as Matt Hirst with 83% &amp; Matt Hodgkinson with 81% sit 2nd &amp; 3rd respectively in the personal merit table.  Hyndburn TTC B are in second spot but the Old Masters have two games in hand and are in third place and may cherish a chance for promotion to the premier which would be a fine achievement for a team averaging somewhere near 80 years old each! Jack Keogh for Brierfield leads the merit table with an 86% average.<p><p>KSB D are top of the table in Division two with a strong lead at present and spurred on by an inform Neil McKinnon holding 2nd spot in the personal merit table with 79%. In second place are Hyndburn TTC D a team of young men led by the stylish Ben Farrar who in top lace of the div 2 merits with 80% is surely set to play at a high level in the coming years. Hyndburn TTC in 3rd place helped by Bryan Edwards 4th in the merits with 76% are capable of promotion if they could consistently field their strongest 3. It is close though with Tackyfire also a threat in 4th place with Elton Atkins going well with 78% and 3rd in the merit table. Whalley Hawks with games in hand can still challenge for a promotion place as well if the excellent young player Kieran Cunliffe stays on form who is presently features in the top 5 merits with 72% but capable of finishing higher than this. <p><p>The third division looks like an all Doals affair at present with 3 of their teams in the top 3. Doals Marauders &amp; Rolling Doals share top spot with 191 points each but the ‘Rollers’ have a game in hand. Ian Mills for Marauders is 3rd in the merits with 76% &amp; a much improved Ryan Fallon for Rolling Doals is 5th on 70%.  Doals Jetstream are in third place but the second half I fancy the juniors of Hyndburn E with first placed merit player Richard Staines on 86% can come on stronger and also Whalley Falcons with several games in hand look to have a strong squad and could rise much higher as well. KSB teams can’t be discounted either and have two players featuring in the merit table top 5, Carlton Cooper 2nd on 82% &amp; Ross Erwin 4th with 75%.<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Whalley Eagles who had no wins to report the first half of the season, have had a happy new year because as well as the win above v Clitheroe they also won 22:15 away to KSB B led by an unbeaten performance from David Borland. Hyndburn TTC B with a good 100% display by David Allen triumphed 21:13 v KSB B &amp;  Brierfield had a second win this time at home 26:12 v Nets N Edges as David Eastwood &amp; Peter Marshland both won all their games.<p><p>Division two:<p>A top of the table clash in Division two saw KSB D win at home v Whalley Hawks 24:18, led by Steve Horner winning 3/3 to keep them on top spot. Whalley Hawks though are presently second after other games this period winning their derby game v Whalley Kestrels 24:16 (3/3 Adam Robinson) &amp; in another promotion battle game narrowly won away 23:21 v Hyndburn TTC where no-one was unbeaten on the night and 5 games went to 5 sets. Hyndburn TTC though are in 3rd place just 4 points behind Hawks and kept the pressure on by a good away win 26:13 v Slayers with Bryan Edwards man of the match with 3/3. Hyndburn TTC D though currently in 5th spot have only lost 1 game and with a game in hand are not far of the pace of a promotion place following a decisive victory over Misfits away 28:9 (Ben Farrar, Charlie McGrath 3/3 each). Adpak Aces trio of Matthew Birch, Paul McGovern &amp; John Farrow  were indeed ‘Ace’ in a   good win over Whalley Kestrels 19:16 despite an inform Martin Drury for Kestrels gaining 100% on the night, who also got 3/3  along with Alan Ross in a fine 27:9 away win v Doals Army.<p><p> <p>Division three:<p>The second half of the season began with a top of the table clash and club derby in Division three between Rolling Doals &amp; Doals Marauders, with a more decisive win than expected by the Rolling trio of Ryan Fallon, Peter &amp; Neil Hepworth by 27:13. This leaves Rolling Doals clear at the top &amp; Marauders in second place.  Doals Jetstream in 3rd spot are just a point behind Marauders with a game in hand after the other Doals derby where Jetstream overcame Vikings 27:6 with Bob Walker winning 3 without loss and Bernie Milnes also 3/3.<p>Two teams capable of still challenging the all Doals affair at the top are Hyndburn TTC E &amp; Whalley Falcons who have played each other twice in the festive New year period winning one game each. Falcons won 23:12 at home, but Hyndburn E won the return fixture 24:16 (in the absence of Steve Nightingale this time for Falcons). The junior Richard Staines for Hyndburn TTC E distinguished himself again by being unbeaten across both matches, with a pleasing win over the also in form Steve Nightingale in the first match. But I fancy it is Falcons who when Kim Croydon &amp; Steve Nightingale both play are a very good team in this division that have the greatest current chance of challenging the Doals grip at the top. Hyndburn TTC F &amp; Whalley Phoenix also played both their home and away games v each other. Phoenix won both games: at home 23:15 (Eric Ronnan 100%, John Price 3/3), away 25:7 (Eric Ronnan 3/3).<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Ian Mills Doals Marauders 71.03<p><p>With about 2/3rd’s of the matches played for most teams, here is an overall report for East Lancs Table Tennis League.<p><p>In the Premier Division Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ are top and unbeaten with two players also first &amp; second respectively in the individual merit table, Michael Moir on 93% &amp; Andrew Jackson on 86%. With just one loss of the season Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ are second spurred on by Dave Kay who is 5th in the merits on 67%. Burnley Boys Club are third with just two losses with their star player Martin Wyatt also 3rd in the merit table on 75%. Only 3 points behind them in 4th though are Ramsbottom ‘A’ led by Mandy Winskill with a personal performance of 74% sets won and 4th in the merit table. Hyndburners &amp; The Lions are in the potential relegation places at present and though Hyndburners could still potentially catch Rovers above them, The Lions look unlikely to get off the bottom spot.<p><p>First Division clear leaders &amp; with a game in hand are KSB ‘A’ who have lost just the once when they were a player short. KSB A’s two Matt’s: Hirst with 85% &amp; Hodgkinson with 75% occupy the top two places in the merit table. The battle for the second promotion spot is still to be won but currently with Barry Hall fourth in the merits on 66% Old Masters have the second spot, 12 points ahead of Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ in third place. Hyndburn TTC ‘B’ are 4th aided by Dave Allen going well on 69% and 5th place in the merit table. Third in the merit is Fred Coghlan on 71%, whose team is HSC.  At the other end KSB ‘C’ are favourites to drop back down to Div 2 next season, though the battle to avoid the other relegation spot is neck and neck between Nets N Edges &amp; Whalley Eagles. Eagles have been improving though of late and will hope to continue up the table.<p><p>Division Two is a close contest all round but Whalley Hawks have their nose in front at the top by 23 points over KSB ‘D’ but having played a game more. KSB ‘D’ Steve Horner is helping their cause with 70% of his sets won and 4th in the personal merits. Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ are a close 3rd led by Bryan Edwards 3rd spot in the merits with a fine 72% &amp; also Stephen Siddall 5th on 70%. With a few less games played I expect Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ who are further down the table can still get amongst it if they can turn out their best team, which includes Ben Farrar top of the merits on 80%. Though Tackyfire are only half way up the table their best player Elton Atkins is flying high in second spot in the merit table with an impressive 78%. Clear relegation favourites are Slayers &amp; Misfits.<p><p>Division three is also far from being decided with any 2 from 5 teams in my opinion that could still win the two promotion spots. However Doals Marauders have been top most of the season and still are on the back of an inform Ian Mills on 71% and 5th in the merit table. Yet current favourites seem to be Doals Jetstream in second spot, 23 points adrift but with two games in hand on the top team. Rolling Doals are also doing well in 3rd place with a game in hand on Jetstream. In 4th place is the young team Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ which appears to be getting stronger as the season progresses and is helped by the superb display all season from Richard Staines who sits top of the merits with an impressive 87%. Though further down but with a few games behind the rest KSB E have only lost 1 game all season on the back of the leading play of Ross Erwin 4th in the merits with 78%. Carlton Cooper is 3rd in the merits with 85% and partly the reason why KSB ‘F’ can’t seem to lose at present, now having won the last 7 games in a row.<p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Hawks aided their promotion bid with a 26:10 away win over the Misfits as Kieran Cunliffe &amp; Adam Robinson were unbeaten. Doals Army won away 20:17 v Adpak Aces with Gerald Laxton for the Army winning 3/3. Adpak Aces managed a shock win though 24:16 v Hyndburn TTC ‘D’, who were weakened by playing two reserves from the lower division, though 3/3 from Charlie McGrath made the result not as bad as it could have been.<p><p>Division three:<p>Doals Jetstream are still well placed to win division 3 despite two losses to report on, losing away 17:20 to KSB F in part due to a superb 100% performance from KSB Carlton Cooper, and then Jetstream also losing 15:23 to club mates Doals Marauders with Ian Mills unbeaten, but also young Dominic Walsh playing the best table tennis of his life to also win all 3 on the night. KSB F again led by Carlton Cooper with 3/3 kept up their winning run of 7 games V Whalley Falcons who without star player Steve Nightingale lost 17:19. Whalley Falcons also had two other losses: 14:20 away to Rolling Doals (Neil Hepworth 3/3) &amp; 16:18 at home to KSB E with KSB Ross Erwin the marginal difference between the two teams with excellent 100% stats on the night. With another unbeaten night by Ross &amp; aided by a 100% display by Michael Mullarkey, KSB E won again at home 24:12 v Whalley Phoenix. Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ with a player down were still impressive in salvaging a draw 16:16 away to Doals Marauders (Richard Staines 3/3). Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ had a good away win 24:15 v Doals Vikings with man of the match being Zac Geldard winning all 3.<p><p>Division One:<p>Just two games to report on : KSB ‘A’ with Matt Hirst &amp; Matt Hodgkinson with 3/3 won away 25:14 v Whalley Eagles, but then KSB ‘A’ lost for the first time this season 17:19 to Clitheroe LMC B, though KSB were a player down and still had man of the match in Daven Argile with 3/3.<p><p>Premier Division:<p>Burnley Boys Club with Martin Wyatt leading the charge unbeaten won 27:13 v Ward &amp; Stobbart.<p>Ramsbottom ‘A’ won 24:19 v East Lancs with Noel Duffy for the Rams the player of the night with 3/3 though all of his wins went to 5 sets!

Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ won a second game 29:11 v Ramsbottom ‘B’ with Dave Kay &amp; Keith Rudd with 3/3 each. Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ are really gaining momentum now, unbeaten and chalking up another 3 large wins this week: 30:11 v Ramsbottom B for masseurs Moir, Walmersley &amp; Young, &amp; the same Hyndburn ‘A’ trio also won 29:9 away to Ward &amp; Stobbart with Dean Walmersley unbeaten again, &amp; Mick Moir actually unbeaten all season. With a different line up Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ notched up a third win of the period 28:6 away to Hyndburners with Andrew Jackson &amp; Mark Ramsbottom with 3/3 each. Rising youngster Charlie McGrath stood in as reserve in this fixture demonstrating his vast and speedy improvement winning two games overall and claiming 7 sets altogether. A great achievement for someone who first played last year in div 3 (now playing in div 2) and a testament to the brilliant job Mick Moir is doing in the coaching of juniors on a Friday night.

The ‘we are not yet 80!’ aged players of The Old Masters are currently set for promotion to the Premier after firming up the second place spot in Division One with a good 25:10 home win over KSB C: John Thornber taking all his 9 sets without loss on the night. Brierfield &amp; KSB B have played both their fixtures against each other in this period winning one game each on the away venues! The results were 14:22 at Kay St in favour of Brierfield despite KSB John Collins winning 3/3, &amp; at Brierfield KSB B were victors 23:16 led by Trevor Elkington with 3/3. Hyndburn TTC B had a good win away v HSC 25:14, with Dave Allen unbeaten and overcoming Fred Coghlan 3:2 in the game of the night. Nets N Edges trio of Alan Prudden, Ian Beecroft, John Burgyone thrashed KSB C at Kay st 30:6 and followed it up with a good home win 24:18 v KSB B with Ian Beecroft with 3/3.<p><p>Division two:<p>KSB D  are still top following two wins 22:15 away to Tackyfire &amp; 24:9 at home to Hyndburn TTC D, aided by an inform Steve Horner 6/6 across the two games including beating the divisions top two players Ben Farrar &amp; Elton Atkins on the way (Steve himself is now 3rd in the merits). Hyndburn TTC D showed more what they are capable of in beating Doals Army 24:11 with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath unbeaten but the two star players need to both feature together in their remaining games if Hyndburn TTC D are to still have any hopes of promotion. The other favourites for promotion at present are Whalley Hawks who won a close game 19:16 this week in the club derby v Whalley Kestrels as Kieran Cunliffe found his form winning 3/3. Kestrels were again on the side of a narrow loss at home 18:19 v Tackyfire who were helped to victory with Elton Atkins being unbeatable on the night. Misfits nearly upset the form books as Keith Ainscoe played superb winning all his games v Hyndburn TTC C but in the end the Hyndburn team pipped them to victory 20:19. With Bryan Edwards undefeated Hyndburn TTC C won again at home to Tackyfire 23:17.<p><p>Division three:<p>Hyndburn TTC E trio of Felicity Pickard, Richard Staines &amp; new signing Adam Kemp romped to victory 30: 5 v Doals Vikings, but lost in a hard fought game 17:20 to Doals Jetstream. It was 17 all before the final doubles was won by Jetstream, but man of the match was again Hyndburn’s Richard Staines though he had a tough game v Bernie Milnes before winning 3:2. Hyndburn TTC E find themselves currently top of the division and will hope a good last 4 games could clinch promotion, but nothing is decided yet! KSB E with only one loss all season and with a number of games to catch up may also still have hopes of promotion not harmed this week by a 26:8 away win over Hyndburn TTC F with Ross Erwin &amp; Michael Mullarkey gaining 100% stats apiece on the night.<p><p>Premier Division:<p>No change at the top of the Premier division as Mick Moir, Mark Ramsbottom &amp; Andrew Jackson empathised their intention to stay champions in a brutal demolition  27:6 of 3rd placed Burnley Boys Club.  East Lancs. trio of Ashley Bradburn, Ian Haworth &amp; Noel Duffy were equally ruthless in a 28:5 thrashing of The Lions, and Rovers helped their survival in the division in a relegation battle victory over Hyndburners 24:14 as Damon &amp; Adam Blezard were undefeated in the match.<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Ward &amp; Stobbart have probably done enough to stay safe in the top flight having beat Hyndburners 22:11on the back of 3/3 for Keith Jackson, though Hyndburners have a lot to do in the remaining games if they are to rise above the relegation zone of the bottom two clubs.

Whalley Eagles scraped the narrowest of home wins 21:20 v Nets ‘N’ Edges with the ‘Edgy’ Ian Beecroft for the losing team gaining 3/3.  KSB ‘B’ with Ray Kay unbeaten this week put themselves in contention for promotion after a great 28:10 demolition of the Old Masters. With Jack Keogh gaining 100% stats in Brierfield’s game v Hyndburn TTC ‘B’ they also had a good victory 24:15. KSB ‘A’ currently in second spot by just 1 point but with 2 or 3 games in hand on the others look  sure favourites for winning the division One title, but the second promotion spot looks wide open and to be decided in the last few games between Old Masters, KSB ‘B’ &amp; Clitheroe LMC ‘B’.  At the other end KSB ‘C’ look doomed for the drop &amp; look most likely to be joined by Whalley Eagles though they could still theoretically with a very good finish just avoid it, but it looks too much to ask at this stage.<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Division Two<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

No-one was unbeaten on the night and a surprising game was an outstanding final game performance from Army’s Don Cunliffe who beat merit table high flyer Steve Horner by 3 sets to 1. Other promotion hopefuls Whalley Hawks with reserve Eric Ronnan having to stand in at the last minute struggled to an 18:16 home win over an improving Adpak Aces, with Kieran Cunliffe again in good form winning all his to help the home side. Adpak Aces had a second game this week and with Paul McGovern achieving 100% on the night &amp; John Farrow also with 3/3, the Aces slew the Slayers 25:12. This Division is wide open yet with KSB ‘D’ &amp; Hawks respectively best placed but still catchable by the two Hyndburn sides (‘C’ &amp; ‘D’) though Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ will need a good finish with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath featuring together in their remaining matches to keep their promotion possibility and to take any advantage of their two games in hand. This weeks game between Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ &amp; Whalley Hawks could be a crucial game in deciding this. Slayers &amp; Misfits are more or less sure of relegation from this Division.<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Division Three<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.	Hyndburn TTC E	15	9	1	5	315<p>2.

Ross Erwin	KSB E	78.07<p><p>Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are going from strength to strength at the moment and with 15 played are top and well placed now for promotion if they can finish well in their last 3 games. This was helped by a brilliant victory away this week over KSB ‘E’ who had only lost one game before this all season. The young Hyndburn team won by just 1 point 20:19 in a match which saw no-one unbeaten and a rare loss for Richard Staines 2:3 to KSB ‘E’s Michael Mullarkey. Rolling Doals will still fancy their chances as they are in 3rd place just 11 points behind the top spot but with two games in hand over the two teams above them. This was on the back of two good wins 30:6 at home to Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ with the young men Ryan Fallon, Peter Hepworth, Isaac Alderson giving nothing away, and then with very good away win against a strong Whalley Falcons side 24:12 (Neil Hepworth 3/3). This weeks clash between Rolling Doals and Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ will be important in this title race. Doals Jetstream are still in the promotion fight in 4th place but lost some ground this week losing 12:23 at home to Whalley Falcons as Steve Nightingale gained 100% stats &amp; Warwick Lewthwaite played beyond his normal level to win two and just lose the 3rd in 5 sets. Doals Marauders in second spot just 6 points behind Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are also still very much in the running for promotion with 3 games to play and won this week 27:9 v Doals Vikings with Ian Mills with 100% on the night.<p>KSB ‘F’ inspired by Carlton Cooper’s merit topping performances kept up their 8 match unbeaten run,  this week v Whalley Phoenix winning 19:14 (Carlton with 100% on the night).<p><p><p><p>', 'press', 1330964354, 'visible', 4),

KSB ‘B’ led forward by Ray Kay (3/3) are also setting their sights on promotion as they won 22:9 v their club colleagues KSB ‘C’. Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ lost a little hope in the promotion battle losing this week to HSC 13:23 with HSC’s Frank Hamer in good form and winning all his games. Old Masters, out of at least 4 teams battling for it, are still best placed to gain the second promotion spot and had good win this week helped by Roger Whewell  (3/3) as they triumphed 26:18 over Whalley Eagles.<p> <p> <p> <p>Division Two<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

Ben did even better winning 3/3 as Hyndburn  ‘A’ overcame The Lions 29:8 as Mick Moir also gained 100% stats and Charlie McGrath stepped up to also do well winning 2/3. Mick Moir will go a season undefeated if he remains unstirred in the one game left for his team.

The top two individual merit places go to Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ junior stars Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath yet despite this their team only managed 3rd place due to lacking a decent regular 3rd player. Still I expect the dynamic young duo will find themselves playing at a higher next season anyway. Whalley Hawks, another young team did well to grab the second promotion spot. Elton Atkins of Tackyfire had a suberb season finishing 3rd in the merit table on 75.42%.

KSB ‘E’ are also very much finishing strongly and with games in hand after another good 29:6 victory over  Doals Vikings this week are still in hot pursuit of the promotion spot.  KSB F again with an impressive clean sheet kept by Carlton Cooper made it 9 wins in a row as they won 22:12 v Hyndburn F.<br><p> <br><p><br><p><br><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Paul McGovern with 70% is playing with a much improved Adpak Aces who by half-way as they catch up with games missed, may make their own promotion challenge this year. Whalley Falcons, Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ &amp; Slayers look set for a 3 way battle at the relegation end of the table, though the youngsters of Hyndburn ‘E’ could emerge the stronger later in the season as they turn their growing skills into match winning capabilities. <br><p><br><p><br><p> <br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

Ward &amp; Stobbart with 7/9 are currently second but only 6 points above East Lancs in 3rd place but who have a game in hand. Ramsbottom’s two premier teams are also doing well and remain in contention for finishing high up the table. At the relegation end of the table Brierfield &amp; Hyndburners are falling behind the rest and will need a radical change of form to avoid the drop this year.  Burnley Boys success is reflected in the individual merit performances with Martin Wyatt in 1st position, Dave Kay at no 2 &amp; Andrea Harrison in 4th.  Graham Hoy from Ramsbottom ‘A’  is in 3rd place and in 5th position is Liam Bedford of East Lancs. <br><p><br><p>Division One<br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

Mavericks spurred on by present leading individual performer Alan Prudden are also going well with 6/8 wins, but really allowing for games behind anything could happen between 7 or 8 teams yet in this Division. The team to watch are currently 5th placed ‘The Lions’ who with a good win from their game behind those above them could easily jump to a top 2 place and try for a ‘boomerang’ back to the premier after their relegation this year (The Lions Martin Ormsby is 3rd in merits). Fixed at the bottom are KSB ‘C’ last years div 2 champions who look set to drop back to div 2 unless there is a massive change in their current form. Other good individual play is being achieved by KSB ‘B’ supremo Trevor Elkington who is 4th in the merits and Whalley Eagles Phil Mileham in 5th. <br><p> <br><p>Division Two<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

The real leaders of the Division are Tackyfire who are clear favourites to win the title with an all-round strong squad featuring 3 players in the top 5 merits: Elton Atkins, Chris Booth &amp; Catherine Lawson. Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ are a rapidly improving young team and are doing well in 3rd place, and could come on even stronger in the second half of the season if Richard Staines continues to impress (3rd in merit table currently). There are 6 or 7 teams all capable of taking points off each other and changing positions in division 2. One team to watch currently under the radar are KSB ‘D’ who if allowing for games in hand could easily find themselves in the promotion race. Stephen Siddall, the best individual performer, from Ramsbottom ‘D’ could help them be a bigger threat if he is able to play more often. Slayers, Whalley Falcons &amp; Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are involved in a closely fought dog fight to avoid relegation from the division.<br><p><br><p> <br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

Burhan Khan	Hyndburn TTC ‘F’	71%<br><p><br><p>Division Three with most teams having reached halfway in games played is a clearer picture. KSB ‘E’ are 7 points clear of their main challengers ‘Misfits’, and both teams boast some of the divisions best players (KSB ‘E’ have Ross Irwin joint no 1 &amp; Carlton Cooper 3rd in merits, Misfits have joint no 1 with Keith Ainscoe).  Doals Marauders are still within touching distance in 3rd place &amp; Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ led by Reece Monk (4th in merits) are 4th in the division. I think those 4 will stay that way at the top, and probably in that order, but I could be proved wrong! The other teenager showing his growing skills in the game is Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ player Burhan Khan. It is great to see so many younger players taking up the game and doing so well.

The reigning champions Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ are a long way down from their usual place, due to investing places in the top flight to nurture young talent, but Mick Moir is still claiming his usual number one place in the merits. Liam Bedford in joint 5th place in the merits is helping East Lancs maintain good form to hold the runners up spot, and League Chairman Ged Simpson’s team Ward &amp; Stobbart are in 3rd. Ramsbottom ‘A’ on the back of Graham Hoy’s good personal form, are in 5th but could rise one or two places when they play their two games in hand.

This time last year his team Whalley Eagles looked doomed for relegation, yet now they sit top of the division! The Lions though with a game in hand are perched nicely in second spot, as Ian Mitchell &amp; Martin Ormsby edge themselves into the merit places. Division One though looks very close and all bar bottom placed KSB ‘C’ could all still keep changing positions. KSB ‘B; will surely rise above their current lowly spot as Craig Milnes is much improved and Trevor Elkington is sailing high in second place in the merits. Barry Hall continues to impress and though his team Old Masters have slipped down into 3rd he will try to spur them on back up into a promotion spot.  Allan Prudden of Mavericks is also performing well but top of the personal stakes is Ramsbottom ‘C’s Dave Allen. KSB ‘C’ have heart and effort but not quite enough form and are set for a drop back down. <br><p><br><p>Division Two<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

With the way the fixtures pan out Tackyfire who are in second place have a harder fixture list at present but an easier run to finish, which probably still makes them favourites for the title and Elton Atkins will continue to spur them on. It is close though in Division Two and Whalley Kestrels have rose to third place, with a much improved Steve Nightingale finding his way into the merits for the first time. Ramsbottom ‘D’ boast the divisions top player in Stephen Siddall and are 4th ,but it is Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ in 5th place but with 2 games in hand who I expect to come out strongest in the latter games to make a push for promotion and with Richard Staines flying high and a vastly improving Adam Kemp, aided by the feisty Felicity Pickard, they are the team to watch out for. Slayers, Whalley Falcons &amp; Hyndburn ‘E’ are adrift from the rest at the bottom and will fight each other in the battle to avoid relegation.<br><p><br><p>  <br><p><br><p> <br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

Their star player Martin Wyatt also grabbed 1st place in the individual merits and team mate Dave Kay grabbed the runner up merit spot. East Lancs finished a great season as Premier Division runners up led by Liam Bedford who finished third in the merits. League Chairman Ged Simpson will be pleased to have his team Ward &amp; Stobbart finish 3rd following a superb season by Keith Ward who finished 4th in the merits. Ramsbottom ‘A’ claimed 4th position and their best player Graham Hoy claimed 5th place in the merits.

Tackyfire were helped by an all-round strong squad but their best player was Elton Atkins who finished 3rd in the individual merits. Likewise Kestrels were aided by a great season from Steve Nightingale who finished 4th in the merits.  Rolling Doals having only got promoted this season to Division Two did well to finish 3rd and just missing out on promotion in consecutive seasons. Doals Neil Hepworth was the merit runner up, but overall merit winner prize goes to Stephen Siddall of Ramsbottom ‘D’.

Hyndburn TTC ‘E finishing bottom &amp; Whalley Falcons just above both face the prospect of relegation. <br><p><br><p>Division Three went down to the last game of the season with KSB’E’ coming out as credible winners over fine runners up Misfits who went the season unbeaten. Not surprisingly both teams had players in the merits, 1st &amp; 2nd places to KSB’s Ross Erwin &amp; Carlton Cooper &amp; 3rd place to Misfit’s Keith Ainscoe. Doals Marauders had a good season to finish 3rd and Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ finished 4th led by merit 4th placed Reece Monk. Bernard Milnes claimed 5th in the merits as his team KSB ‘F’ also finished 5th.

Ward & Stobbart with 3 wins & 1 loss sit in second place at the moment. The only other unbeaten premier team are Ramsbottom Exiles but they have only played two. The only team not to record a win are newly promoted â€˜The Lionsâ€™, who will hope to notch up a victory soon if they are to avoid a drop straight down.\r\nIn Division 1 two teams remain unbeaten at present which are Hyndburners & Brierfield but they have played a game less than KSB B & Whalley Eagles who sit top respectively with 3 out of 4 wins thus far. Early strugglers in Div 1 with no wins to present are Tackyfire, Ramsbottom Exiles b & Brierfield B.\r\nDivision two favourites this year Old Masters B have started with intent with 4 out of 4 wins and have already opened up a 12 point gap over the other team with 100% wins which is Rolling Doals. Bottom two Slayers & Whalley Kites are already in trouble and will have to find something extra if they are to lift themselves off those places.\r\nDoals Marauders in division 3 have made the best start of the whole league amassing a massive 118 points out of a possible 120 in four games played. But the team to watch who may challenge them and are also unbeaten are Hyndburn TTC C. KSB F & the new entry this year Best Centre have started well with 3 out of 4 wins. KSB E sit bottom, but that is sure to change as they play more games.\r\nIf anyone of any age wants to know where and how to start playing table tennis please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451\r\n\r\n\r\nBurnley Perspective \r\nThere are 6 Burnley based teams playing in the East Lancashire Table Tennis league this year. The reigning Premier league champions are from Burnley and the â€˜Burnley Boys Clubâ€™ have made a great start to this years campaign with four out of four wins and already on top and hoping to bring the title back to Burnley again this year.\r\nIn Division 1, the two Brierfield Teams are competing. Brierfield first team have 3 out of 3 wins so far and should be capable challenging for a promotion spot this year, whilst Brierfield â€˜Bâ€™ may struggle at the bottom end of division 1 and be involved in the fight to avoid relegation having played 2 and lost 2 thus far. \r\nThe lads from Adpak Aces, based in the Lomeshaye Industrial estate factory Adpak Machinery, are always competitive and play in Division 2 and have won 1 out of 3 up to now but likely to be well above the relegation zone over the season.\r\nDivision 3 welcomes two new teams from Burnley this year, â€˜Best Centreâ€™ & â€˜Best Centre Young Gunsâ€™ playing out of the Best Centre facility just off junction 9 M65 near Hapton. They have made a good league debut both having recorded their first wins, and the first team actually winning 3 out of 4 currently. We wish them well and if anyone else of any age in Burnley wants to know where and how to start playing please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451\r\n\r\nRossendale Perspective \r\n\r\n11 teams based around three Clubs in Rossendale from Ramsbottom Town, Kay St Baptist Church (Rawtenstall) & Doals Community Centre (Weir, Bacup) are participating in the East Lancs Table Tennis League this year.\r\nIn the Premier Division Ramsbottom Town A have won 2 out of 3 up to now and will hope to finish in the top half by the end of the season. Another Rossendale premier side are KSB â€˜A, with 1 out of 3 wins will be hoping to consolidate their status as a premier division side this year having been promoted the year before last, but  will need to fight hard and play well over the season to ensure this.\r\nIn Division 1, KSB B have made a good start and sit top with 3 out of 4 & Ramsbottom Town B, with 2 out of 3 are presently half way up the table.\r\nIn Division two Bacup based Rolling Doals with 4 out of 4 wins will strive hard for a promotion place having just missed out last year, but KSB C who were demoted from Div 1 will also hope to try and go back up at the first attempt. KSB D, newly promoted to the division have challenged well and are doing better than just 1 out of 4 wins looks, because they have played and lost to 3 of the top sides in the division but likely to start winning some of the others when their best 3 play together.\r\nIn Division 3, Doals Marauders have made the best start of any team in the league amassing an impressive 118 out of 120 points possible in 4 straight wins and will take some catching. Doals Vikings are finding it harder but still competing well and have won 1 out of 4 games. KSB F have made a good start with 3 out of 4 wins and could be in the promotion race, but slow starters KSB E will also do much better than their present results are showing.\r\nIf anyone of any age in Rossendale wants to know where and how to start playing table tennis please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'press', 1382453520, 'visible', 4),

and East Lancs 1st\r\nwho are fighting it out to be champions. In the top of the title clash just\r\nbefore Christmas East Lancs spurred on by an in form Liam Bedford gained the\r\nbragging rights in a fine 23:18 home win over Burnley Boys. Both now have\r\nplayed 10 with one loss but Burnley boys are still favourites at this stage due\r\nto a 19 point gap over the East Lancs team.\r\nWhen games in hand by some teams are accounted for, at the moment Hyndburn TTC\r\nâ€˜Aâ€™ &amp; The Lions are the most likely to be relegated from the top flight,\r\nbut it is only half way and there are still plenty of points to play for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division One the East\r\nLancs 2nd team are also involved at the top and currently sit top,\r\nbut like their first team may have to settle for second spot as the undefeated\r\ncurrent second placed Brierfield, with a game in hand, and with the top two\r\nmerit performers in Jack Keogh &amp; David Eastwood, will probably leapfrog\r\nabove them at some stage.&nbsp; In contrast to\r\nthe fortunes of the â€˜Aâ€™ team, Brierfied â€˜Bâ€™ are firmly set in bottom position\r\nand Tackyfire just above them look also likely to be relegated unless they have\r\na massive second half turn around in results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division Two, Old Masters\r\nâ€˜Bâ€™ having signed on new player Howard Whewell (son of Roger in same team), who\r\nis making a return to the sport, have changed the balance massively in their\r\nfavour and sit comfortably top. Howard based on his first two games with 100%\r\nperformances looks too good at this level and capable of maintaining 100%&nbsp; the rest of the campaign. So it looks like\r\nsecond place KSB C, 3rd place Whalley Hawks &amp; 4th\r\nplaced Rolling Doals are now playing for second spot at best, with all of these\r\n3 determined and able to claim the second promotion place. At the bottom are\r\nSlayers with Whalley Kites above them who look a safe bet already to go down</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division 3, the\r\nundefeated Doals Marauders have a 40 point lead at the top, but they have now\r\nlooked to have lost top merit performer Roman Mychajlshyn to work commitments\r\nfor the rest of the season and so with other squad injury &amp; work type\r\navailability issues, the journey to the title may be less sure and more fraught\r\nin the second half. Best Centre in their debut season are going well in second\r\nspot, and 3rd placed Hyndburn TTC &nbsp;â€˜Câ€™ are also in contention. But KSB E in 4th\r\nwith their game in hand also have their eye on promotion and could move up to\r\nsecond when they catch up with their fixtures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info in how to start\r\nplaying TT contact league development office Harry Rawcliffe on Tel 01254\r\n663451</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Burnley</b><b> Focus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the first half of the\r\nseasonâ€™s fixtures complete Burnley Boys club look on course to retain the\r\npremier title due to a 19 point lead, despite a loss to second placed East\r\nlancs just before Christmas. &nbsp;Burnley\r\nBoys â€˜old boy veteranâ€™ Dave Kay &amp; â€˜best ladyâ€™ Andrea Harrison feature 3rd\r\n&amp; 4th in the merits. In Division 1 Brierfield are undefeated in\r\nsecond spot but able to be first placed when a game in hand is played, and\r\nboast the top two merit players in Jack Keogh &amp; Dave Eastwood. Whatever\r\nhappens Brierfield are a good bet for promotion to the top flight. However,\r\nBrierfield â€˜Bâ€™ at the foot of the table are set for a fall down to the lower\r\ndivision. In Division 2, Adpak Aces are carrying the Burnley\r\nflag, and are acquitting themselves well with 4 wins &amp; 4 losses to remain a\r\nsteady mid table team. Best Centre in division 3 are a new club to the league\r\nthis season. Their â€˜Aâ€™ team is going well in second spot, but will have to have\r\na very good second half of the season if they are to stay there and gain\r\npromotion at first time of asking. Their other team the â€˜Best Young Gunsâ€™ are\r\nabout mid-table and can be pleased with their debut campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Centre is open to new\r\nplayers and beginners to join their club on a Monday night (Contact Darren\r\nWright for more info on 07736473609)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Rossendale Focus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The highest placed\r\nRossendale based team is Ramsbottom\r\n Town â€˜Aâ€™ presently placed\r\n3rd in the premier division and the other Rossendale based premier\r\nteam is KSB â€˜Aâ€™ who are pleased to be holding their own in 6th\r\nplace. In Division One Ramsbottom Town B are playing well in 3rd\r\nplace just behind the promotion places, &amp;&nbsp;\r\nKSB B are 7th &nbsp;but\r\nlikely to rise a few places when catch up games are played. In Division two KSB\r\nâ€˜Câ€™ are getting stronger as the seasons goes on and have lifted themselves into\r\nsecond spot. Bacup based Rolling Doals are 4th with just one loss inspired by\r\nmerit topper Neil Hepworth &amp; with Ian Smith also 5th in the\r\nmerits and with two games in hand on KSB â€˜Câ€™ will also have hopes yet of\r\npromotion. Another Rossendale div Two team is KSB â€˜Dâ€™ near the bottom end but\r\nprobably safe from relegation, and have merit placed player Carlton Cooper to\r\nkeep it so. Division 3 has four Rossendale teams and it is Weir villageâ€™s Doals\r\nMarauders with 3 merit featuring players: Roman Mychajlshyn, David Greenwood\r\n&amp; Jon Andrews who lead by a 40 point gap and are undefeated. KSB â€˜Eâ€™ are 4th\r\nbut with a game in hand have a real opportunity to get in the second promotion\r\nspot. KSB â€˜Fâ€™ are 6th placed and have young Will Cooper doing very\r\nwell in the second merit place. Doals Vikings are 8th but as their 5\r\nout of 9 wins shows on their day they can give any team in the division a run\r\nfor their money, and they do boast two of this seasonâ€™s most improved players\r\nin Bob Thompson &amp; young Thomas Summer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info of how to start\r\nplaying TT in Rossendale contact Ramsbottomâ€™s Bryan Edwards on 01617975082, or\r\nDoals (Bacup) Neil Hepworth on 07873834942, or KSB (Rawtenstall) Trevor\r\nElkington on 07981387755.</p>', 'press', 1388063382, 'hidden', 1),

and East Lancs 1st\r\nwho are fighting it out to be champions. In the top of the title clash just\r\nbefore Christmas East Lancs spurred on by an in form Liam Bedford gained the\r\nbragging rights in a fine 23:18 home win over Burnley Boys. Both now have\r\nplayed 10 with one loss but Burnley boys are still favourites at this stage due\r\nto a 19 point gap over the East Lancs team.\r\nWhen games in hand by some teams are accounted for, at the moment Hyndburn TTC\r\nâ€˜Aâ€™ &amp; The Lions are the most likely to be relegated from the top flight,\r\nbut it is only half way and there are still plenty of points to play for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division\r\nOne the East Lancs 2nd team are also involved at the top and\r\ncurrently sit top, but like their first team may have to settle for second spot\r\nas the undefeated current second placed Brierfield, with a game in hand, and\r\nwith the top two merit performers in Jack Keogh &amp; David Eastwood, will\r\nprobably leapfrog above them at some stage.&nbsp;\r\nIn contrast to the fortunes of the â€˜Aâ€™ team, Brierfied â€˜Bâ€™ are firmly\r\nset in bottom position and Tackyfire just above them look also likely to be\r\nrelegated unless they have a massive second half turn around in results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division\r\nTwo, Old Masters â€˜Bâ€™ having signed on new player Howard Whewell (son of Roger\r\nin same team), who is making a return to the sport, have changed the balance\r\nmassively in their favour and sit comfortably top. Howard based on his first\r\ntwo games with 100% performances looks too good at this level and capable of\r\nmaintaining 100%&nbsp; the rest of the\r\ncampaign. So it looks like second place KSB C, 3rd place Whalley\r\nHawks &amp; 4th placed Rolling Doals are now playing for second spot\r\nat best, with all of these 3 determined and able to claim the second promotion\r\nplace. At the bottom are Slayers with Whalley Kites above them who look a safe\r\nbet already to go down</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Division\r\n3, the undefeated Doals Marauders have a 40 point lead at the top, but they\r\nhave now looked to have lost top merit performer Roman Mychajlshyn to work\r\ncommitments for the rest of the season and so with other squad injury &amp;\r\nwork type availability issues, the journey to the title may be less sure and\r\nmore fraught in the second half. Best Centre in their debut season are going\r\nwell in second spot, and 3rd placed Hyndburn TTC &nbsp;â€˜Câ€™ are also in contention. But KSB E in 4th\r\nwith their game in hand also have their eye on promotion and could move up to\r\nsecond when they catch up with their fixtures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info in\r\nhow to start playing TT contact league development office Harry Rawcliffe on Tel\r\n01254 663451</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Burnley</b><b>\r\nFocus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the\r\nfirst half of the seasonâ€™s fixtures complete Burnley Boys club look on course\r\nto retain the premier title due to a 19 point lead, despite a loss to second\r\nplaced East lancs just before Christmas. &nbsp;Burnley Boys â€˜old boy veteranâ€™ Dave Kay &amp;\r\nâ€˜best ladyâ€™ Andrea Harrison feature 3rd &amp; 4th in the\r\nmerits. In Division 1 Brierfield are undefeated in second spot but able to be\r\nfirst placed when a game in hand is played, and boast the top two merit players\r\nin Jack Keogh &amp; Dave Eastwood. Whatever happens Brierfield are a good bet\r\nfor promotion to the top flight. However, Brierfield â€˜Bâ€™ at the foot of the\r\ntable are set for a fall down to the lower division. In Division 2, Adpak Aces\r\nare carrying the Burnley flag, and are\r\nacquitting themselves well with 4 wins &amp; 4 losses to remain a steady mid table\r\nteam. Best Centre in division 3 are a new club to the league this season. Their\r\nâ€˜Aâ€™ team is going well in second spot, but will have to have a very good second\r\nhalf of the season if they are to stay there and gain promotion at first time\r\nof asking. Their other team the â€˜Best Young Gunsâ€™ are about mid-table and can\r\nbe pleased with their debut campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Centre\r\nis open to new players and beginners to join their club on a Monday night (Contact\r\nDarren Wright for more info on 07736473609)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Rossendale Focus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The highest\r\nplaced Rossendale based team is Ramsbottom\r\n Town â€˜Aâ€™ presently placed\r\n3rd in the premier division and the other Rossendale based premier\r\nteam is KSB â€˜Aâ€™ who are pleased to be holding their own in 6th\r\nplace. In Division One Ramsbottom Town B are playing well in 3rd\r\nplace just behind the promotion places, &amp;&nbsp;\r\nKSB B are 7th &nbsp;but\r\nlikely to rise a few places when catch up games are played. In Division two KSB\r\nâ€˜Câ€™ are getting stronger as the seasons goes on and have lifted themselves into\r\nsecond spot. Bacup based Rolling Doals are 4th with just one loss inspired by\r\nmerit topper Neil Hepworth &amp; with Ian Smith also 5th in the\r\nmerits and with two games in hand on KSB â€˜Câ€™ will also have hopes yet of\r\npromotion. Another Rossendale div Two team is KSB â€˜Dâ€™ near the bottom end but\r\nprobably safe from relegation, and have merit placed player Carlton Cooper to\r\nkeep it so. Division 3 has four Rossendale teams and it is Weir villageâ€™s Doals\r\nMarauders with 3 merit featuring players: Roman Mychajlshyn, David Greenwood\r\n&amp; Jon Andrews who lead by a 40 point gap and are undefeated. KSB â€˜Eâ€™ are 4th\r\nbut with a game in hand have a real opportunity to get in the second promotion\r\nspot. KSB â€˜Fâ€™ are 6th placed and have young Will Cooper doing very\r\nwell in the second merit place. Doals Vikings are 8th but as their 5\r\nout of 9 wins shows on their day they can give any team in the division a run\r\nfor their money, and they do boast two of this seasonâ€™s most improved players\r\nin Bob Thompson &amp; young Thomas Summer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info of\r\nhow to start playing TT in Rossendale contact Ramsbottomâ€™s Bryan Edwards on\r\n01617975082, or Doals (Bacup) Neil Hepworth on 07873834942, or KSB\r\n(Rawtenstall) Trevor Elkington on 07981387755.</p>', 'press', 1388083717, 'visible', 4),

Hyndburn TTC â€˜Aâ€™ &amp; The Lions below them have their work cut out\r\nto avoid relegation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nOne East Lancs 2nd are going strong on top and look good for the\r\ntitle. Brierfield are probably a safe bet for the runner up spot to clinch the\r\nother promotion slot once they catch up with missed fixtures. Brierfield â€˜Bâ€™\r\nare on course for dropping in the opposite direction and are likely to be\r\njoined by Tackyfire who are still looking for their first win of the season.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Masters â€˜Aâ€™\r\nare racing ahead now towards the Second Division title, with the second promotion\r\nplace a close call at present between second place Rolling Doals &amp; Third\r\nplaced Whalley Hawks.

Hyndburn\r\nTTC â€˜Câ€™ are at the present on top but I think they will be overtaken by KSB E\r\nin third at present as well as Marauders when catch up games are played.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info in\r\nhow to start playing TT contact league development office Harry Rawcliffe on Tel\r\n01254 663451</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Burnley</b><b>\r\nFocus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Burnley Boys\r\nwith Dave Kay &amp; Andrea Harrison 3rd and 5th in the\r\nmerit tables are helping the team to stay on course to retain the Premier title\r\nwith two thirds of all fixtures played.

In Division One KSB â€˜Aâ€™ are in a credible 3rd\r\nplace &amp; Ramsbottom Town B are playing well in 6th place. In\r\nDivision Two Bacup team Rolling Doals are second and hoping they can gain\r\npromotion if Neil Hepworth top of the merit and Ian Smith (4th) maintain\r\ntheir form, and in 4th place are KSB â€˜Câ€™.

a\r\nmonth of the season left the likely winners, promoted and to be relegated looks\r\nto be decided in most cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In the\r\nPremier Division Burnley Boys Club, boasting 3 top 5 merit performers (Dave Kay\r\n1st, Martin Wyatt 2nd, Andrea Harrison 5th)\r\nhave a 29 point lead over 2nd placed East Lancs 1st, and\r\nlook sure to retain the league champions crown first won last year. East Lancs\r\nthough are equally sure of the runners up spot helped by another impressive\r\nseason by 4th merit placed player Liam Bedford. Ramsbottom Exiles\r\nDavid Poytress is 4th in the merits. However the battle to avoid\r\nrelegation in the Premier has become quite changed now that a late season\r\nreturn of Michael Moir alongside Graham Young for Hyndburn TTC â€˜Aâ€™ has lifted\r\nthem out of trouble. Unfortunately it now appears that KSB â€˜Aâ€™ , are now\r\nrelegation favourites alongside The Lions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nOne East Lancs 2nd are set to win and have 3 players in the top 5\r\nmerits (Mark Hanson 3rd , Alan Whittle 4th , Ian Haworth\r\n5th ), and the runners up and other team to be promoted is also very\r\nsure in Brierfield â€˜Aâ€™ who boast the divisions best performing player in Jack\r\nKeogh.&nbsp; Hyndburners&nbsp; Duncan Rigby currently holds the second spot\r\nin the merits. Likely to stay in the relegation zone are bottom placed\r\nBrierfield â€˜Bâ€™ and second from bottom Tackyfire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Old Masters â€˜Bâ€™\r\nare unassailable now in their chasing for Division two honours, and though\r\nhaving not played enough to feature in the official merits, they do have the\r\nbest player by far in Howard Whewell, who has only dropped one set to the\r\nplucky youngster this last week, Zack Geldard of Hyndburn â€˜B. Old Masters\r\nsuccess is a team effort though and feature two top 5 merit players in Ian\r\n&amp; Albert Pickles (2nd &amp; 3rd respectively)â€™.\r\nWhalley Hawks are also sure of promotion having thrashed Rolling Doals in\r\nrecent weeks, and aided by 4th placed merit player Kieron Cunliffe\r\nwho seems to have found his spark again. The Rollers will miss out again\r\ndespite two of the divisions best players (Neil Hepworth 1st in\r\nmerits &amp; Ian Smith 6th in merits). Slayers at the foot of the\r\ntable and Whalley Kites 3rd from bottom are set on course for the\r\nrelegation positions. KSB â€˜Dâ€™ led by 5th merit placed player Carlton\r\nCooper will lift themselves out of relegation trouble when they catch up with\r\ntheir fixtures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nThree Doals Marauders are uncatchable and the only unbeaten team left in the\r\nwhole of the league, aided by Roman Mychajlshyn &amp; Dave Greenwood (1st\r\n&amp; 3rd in merits). KSB â€˜Eâ€™ are also looking secure for the second\r\npromotion spot with Bernard Milnes 6th in merits and with son Simon\r\nhaving made massive improvement over the season, not to mention his steady hard\r\nto beat brother Paul (if they can persuade the other brother Craig to return\r\nnext season they may well hold their own in division two). Three youths occupy\r\nthe other top 5 merit positions: Will Cooper of KSB F, Eli Smith of Hyndburn\r\nTTC â€˜Dâ€™, &amp; Frances Kinsella of Hyndburn â€˜Dâ€™, who also whilst playing as\r\nreserve in second recently engineered a great 3:2 win over div 2 merit topper\r\nNeil Hepworth).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info in\r\nhow to start playing TT contact league development office Harry Rawcliffe on Tel\r\n01254 663451</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Burnley</b><b>\r\nFocus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>There is just\r\na month of the season left, but In the Premier Division Burnley Boys Club,\r\nboasting 3 top 5 merit performers (Dave Kay 1st, Martin Wyatt 2nd,\r\nAndrea Harrison 5th) look sure to retain the East lancs TT league\r\nchampions crown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nOne &nbsp;Brierfield â€˜Aâ€™ are almost certainly\r\ngoing to be promoted and take the runners up spot, and also currently boast 1st\r\nplace in the individual player merit table in Jack Keogh.

KSB â€˜Dâ€™ are\r\nsecond to bottom but should get to safety when games are caught up with. Two\r\nValley players feature in the merits, Neil Hepworth of Rolling Doals is 1st\r\nat present and Carlton Cooper of KSB â€˜Dâ€™ is 5th.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nThree two Rossendale teams look favourites for promotion, the unbeaten Doals\r\nMarauders top the division with Roman Mychajlshyn &nbsp;&amp; Dave Greenwood top of the merits, and\r\nthe family Milnes team KSB â€˜Eâ€™ look safe for the runners up spot. KSB F, are 5th\r\nbut boast 3rd placed merit player Will Cooper and Doals Vikings are\r\n6th. A late registered new Valley player is Lee Barnes, who has\r\nrecently taken up the sport and made a great debut for Doals Marauders this\r\nweek winning two matches.

Premier Division champions Burnley Boys Club who have won the\r\ntitle for the second year running. They also boast the Premier Individual merit\r\ntitle winner Dave Kay, though his team mate Keith Lee performed slightly better\r\nbut just missed not playing enough sets to qualify. With Martin Wyatt also\r\nfinishing 5th in the merits we can see why Burnley Boys were\r\ntriumphant.&nbsp; East Lancs 1st\r\npushed them close this year in runners up spot, evident from clinching 2nd\r\n&amp; 3rd places in the individual merit places via Liam Bedford\r\n&amp; Matt Nettleton. With their team mate Ashley Bradburn only missing out on\r\na merit place by falling short by just 4 sets to make the 112 sets required to\r\nqualify it still caps a great season by East Lancs, who may fancy they can go\r\none better next season. Ged Simpson, hardworking League Chairman will be\r\npleased with his team, Ward &amp; Stobbart finishing 3rd as well as\r\nbeing runners up in the Fred Holden Handicap Team Cup. Graham Hoy of Ramsbottom\r\nExiles â€˜Aâ€™ came 4th in the merit table. Teams going down are bottom\r\nplaced The Lions &amp; Kay Street Baptist â€˜Aâ€™, whose genuine mistake in\r\nmisunderstanding the reserve rule cost them the points that could have kept\r\nthem up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In Division\r\nOne East Lancs 2nd are runaway winners and have 3 players in the top\r\n5 merits (Mark Hanson 2nd &nbsp;,\r\nAlan Whittle 3rd &nbsp;, Ian\r\nHaworth 5th ), and will show I think that they are genuine Premier\r\nstandard next year. Brierfield â€˜Aâ€™ clinth the other promotion place as runners\r\nup and top individual player in Jack Keogh. Whalley Eagles whose best player of\r\nthe season was Phil Mileham finished 3rd. The other top 5 merit\r\nposition though was the ever consistent Hyndburners Duncan Rigby who gained 4th\r\nplace. The relegated teams are bottom placed Brierfield â€˜Bâ€™ &amp; Tackyfire,\r\nwho are having a bit of a â€˜yo-yoâ€™ experience in recent years between Div 1\r\n&amp; Div 2, but were unlucky in that they finished the same points as Whalley Kestrels\r\nso were divided by games won in which Ketsrals came out on top to just stay up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Old Masters â€˜Bâ€™\r\nwere never in doubt for the Division Two title once former National League\r\nplayer Howard Whewell joined them last November. Though he hadnâ€™t played for\r\nabout ten years his quality showed immediately at this level dropping just two sets\r\nand only missing out on the merit title due to not playing enough games. A fine\r\nplayer, with a good temperament who I am sure will take division 1 by storm\r\nnext season. It wasnâ€™t just a one man show though and that other Old Master Ian\r\nPickles did his part and claimed 3rd place in the merit league.\r\nWhalley Hawks were worthy runners up, with a strong squad led by merit runner\r\nup Kieran Cunliffe, who had a great second half of the season. Again they lost\r\npoints which meant they would have got closer to Old Masters than they did,\r\nbecause of a genuine mistake over the reserve rule. Rolling Doals were\r\ndisappointed to finish 3rd for the second year running and miss out\r\non the automatic promotion places again, despite Neil Hepworth claiming the\r\nindividual merit title &amp; Ian Smith finishing 6th. Young man\r\nZachary Geldhard of Hyndburn TTC â€˜Dâ€™ finished strong to be 4th in\r\nthe merits, but apart from Howard Whewell was probably the divisions best\r\nplayer in the second half of the season and is ready for a move up to a higher\r\ndivision. KSB â€˜Dâ€™ escaped relegation in the end and finished 7th &nbsp;helped by 5th placed merit achiever\r\nCarlton Cooper. The demoted teams are bottom placed Slayers &amp; Ramsbottom\r\nExiles â€˜Câ€™.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Despite\r\nlosing their 100% record to a loss &amp; draw in the last two games of the\r\nseason when due to player shortage they had to play with a player short, Doals\r\nMarauders were comfortable Division Three champions, led by the steady and\r\nconsistent David Greenwood who won the individual performance honours, and\r\njoined regularly through the season by Jon Andrews who had a good campaign as well.\r\nThe runners up and also promoted are KSB â€˜Eâ€™, with Bernard Milnes having a good\r\nseason and finishing 4th in the merits.&nbsp; Hyndburn TTC â€˜Câ€™ finished 3rd,\r\nwith youngster Francis Kinsella also finishing runner up in the merits, who\r\nalong with Eli Smith from Hyndburn TTC â€˜Dâ€™ who fell just a few sets played short\r\nto claim the runner up place himself, should perform well together if put in a\r\ndivision 2 team in the Hyndburn club next year. Best Centre deserve a mention\r\nin their debut season doing very well with their first team finishing 4th\r\n(Jordan Moore claiming the 5th merit place as well) &amp; their\r\nYoung Guns finishing 5th. The Young Guns were also victorious in The\r\nFred Holden Team Handicap Cup. A great start for the new Burnley Club who hope\r\nto do even better and field more teams next season. Finally KSB â€˜Fâ€™s Will\r\nCooper deserves a mention for finishing 3rd in the merits</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For info in\r\nhow to start playing TT or how to join a club contact league development office\r\nHarry Rawcliffe on Tel 01254 663451</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Burnley Focus</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Burnley based\r\nteams have done well this season and boast East Lancs.
